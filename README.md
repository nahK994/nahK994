I am Shomi Khan, a panda type of guy, who is passionate about programming especially on automation, Python based web app development.
I also love eating, cycling, watching animes. My favourite anime is ''Attack on Titan".

I am a lone wolf but worked as a team player in professional life. I always craving to find a team with a friendly and flexible environment where I can find mental peace and learning opportunity.<br/><br/>
Ohhhh, that was some serious talks.<br/>
Ok... Let's just chill a bit ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜

I love riding my bicycle by the river, thinking about complex programming problems, and then chilling out while putting all the solutions together in a relaxed place ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ.

I will try my best to respond you as quick as possible.
Thanks in advance...... ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
